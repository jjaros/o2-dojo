# Kata: Minesweeper

## Introduction
Add the numbers to a minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines 
using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent 
(horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code 
that counts the number of mines adjacent to a square 
and transforms boards like this (where * indicates a mine):

_Note:_ Only one-dimensional mines are implemented just now 
(should be extended in next session).

### Example
This input mine game...
```
+-----+
| * * |
+-----+
```

...should be computed into this:
```
+-----+
|1*2*1|
+-----+
```
